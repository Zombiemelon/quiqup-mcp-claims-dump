/**
 * orders-graphql-v1 — first eval dataset for the Phase-3 Orders Core GraphQL
 * family (lookup_orders_ids + bulk_orders_lookup).
 *
 * Each item: a natural-language merchant question + the canonical Phase-3
 * Orders-Core-GraphQL tool call. Scored by ../score-orders-graphql.ts.
 *
 * The dataset spans the family's disambiguation surface:
 *   - lookup_orders_ids   → clientOrderID-only listing, where-filtered,
 *                            cursor-paginated.
 *   - bulk_orders_lookup  → per-item weights + parcel barcodes for a known
 *                            set of clientOrderIDs, capped at 200.
 *
 * No real merchant data — clientOrderIDs are obvious placeholders.
 *
 * Tool-side reference (lib/tools/*.ts):
 *   lookup_orders_ids   — { first?, last?, after?, before?, where?, orderBy?, environment? }
 *   bulk_orders_lookup  — { client_order_ids: number[], environment? }
