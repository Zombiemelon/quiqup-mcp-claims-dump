/**
 * PII redaction for audit-log arg capture.
 *
 * Why this module exists: M6 audit (lib/middleware/audit.ts) records every
 * tool invocation, including the arguments the LLM passed. Last-Mile order
 * args contain real recipient/sender personal data — names, phone numbers,
 * physical addresses — that we must NEVER persist into structured logs.
 * GDPR + the Quiqup data-handling policy treat aggregated Vercel runtime
 * logs as a downstream system; PII in there is a breach by default.
 *
 * Design stance: WHITELIST, not blacklist. A whitelist of keys that are
 * known-safe (ids, enums, payment_mode literals) is sound — anything else
 * gets `[REDACTED]`. Blacklisting (redact "name", "phone" etc.) is unsafe
 * because new schema fields land all the time and the redactor would
 * silently leak them. Conservative over-redaction is the explicit choice;
 * audit logs lose some debug context but never leak.
 *
 * Tool-family switch: the function takes the tool name so we can vary the
 * whitelist by tool family. Read-only tools (get_*, list_*, recent_*) take
 * essentially just ids and filters — the whitelist there is broad. Write
 * tools that touch Last-Mile order shapes (create_lastmile_order, update_*)
 * get the strict whitelist. Bulk-product / inbound tools sit in between.
 *
 * M7 hand-off: the audit pipeline (M7) may route to a real SIEM with
 * field-level access control. At that point a smarter redactor that emits
 * `{ field: <type>, redacted: true }` instead of bare `"[REDACTED]"`
 * markers becomes worthwhile, so downstream queries can filter on
 * "tools that received a phone-shaped value" without seeing the value.
 * Out of scope for M6.

/**
 * Keys safe to surface verbatim in audit logs, across ALL tools. These are
 * structural identifiers / enums / dimension descriptors with no PII
 * payload. Derived from existing tool input schemas under lib/tools/.
 *
 * Note: if you're tempted to add anything here that could carry a customer
 * value (e.g. `notes`, `description`, free-text `name`), DON'T. Add it to
 * a tool-family-specific list below instead, or just accept the redaction
 * and dig into the upstream API response if you need the value to debug.
