// Phase 2 of the two-phase bulk product upload, paired with
// bulk_validate_products. Run bulk_validate_products FIRST to surface
// per-row issues — commit only after the validate phase reports clean
// (or with acceptable errors).
//
// Scope model: NO scope-check helper call here. The exchanged Quiqup
// session JWT is itself the scope — platform-api routes the request to the
// caller's own product catalogue based on the JWT subject. There is no
// cross-tenant attack surface to gate at the MCP layer: the upstream
// rejects writes against another merchant's products by virtue of the JWT
// being merchant-scoped. The other M6 guardrails (rate-limit, idempotency,
// audit) still apply because the blast radius within the caller's own
// catalogue is potentially large.
//
// Idempotency TTL is 30 minutes (vs the M6 default 15) because a bulk
// commit can be slow to process upstream and clients legitimately retry
// after long backoff windows; 30m makes "same key, same body" replays
// safe across realistic retry curves.
//
// Rate limit is the tightest in the M6 surface (2 commits / 60s): each
// call mutates many rows at once, and the operator-facing recovery cost
// of a runaway loop is correspondingly higher.
//
// Input shape: base64 CSV body for symmetry with bulk_validate_products
// (the MCP transport has no native file upload primitive). filename is
// retained as a hint for the upstream; idempotency_key is the M6 replay
// guard.
