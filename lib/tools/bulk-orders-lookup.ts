/**
 * `bulk_orders_lookup` — re-fetch a bulk set of Quiqup orders (with
 * per-item weights + parcel barcodes) by `clientOrderID` via the Orders
 * Core GraphQL `bulkOrdersLookupQuery`
 * (Phase 3 / ORDL-03 → `bulkOrdersLookupQuery`).
 *
 * Endpoint: POST https://orders-api.quiqup.com/graph
 *   (or orders-api.staging.quiqup.com/graph when `environment: "staging"`).
 * Headers: Authorization: Bearer <session-JWT> (Clerk → Quiqup actor-token
 *   bridge — IDENTICAL to the REST tools), Accept/Content-Type JSON.
 *
 * Typical flow: agent calls `lookup_orders_ids` to discover a matching set,
 * then `bulk_orders_lookup` with the resulting `clientOrderID`s to fetch the
 * per-item weights + parcel barcodes — typically because a follow-up
 * mutation (bulk weight update, mission add-by-id) needs them.
 *
 * GraphQL contract notes:
 *   - The `query` string is an inline CONSTANT — never built from caller
 *     data (threat T-03-08). Variables go on the GraphQL `variables`
 *     envelope; the wire serializer is `JSON.stringify`, no concatenation.
 *   - Selection set MUST match the Quiqdash frontend's
 *     `app/graphql/queries/bulk-orders-lookup.query.ts` because Orders
 *     Core treats query text as the response contract — see
 *     docs/quiqup-api-full-frontend-extract.md §19 E lines 4504-4516.
 *   - Upstream hard-caps the request at `first: 200`; we mirror that cap
 *     at the schema layer (`z.array(...).max(200)`) so an over-large
 *     request is rejected loudly client-side rather than silently
 *     truncated by the upstream.
 *   - HTTP non-2xx → QuiqupHttpError (registerTool wrapper unwraps to
 *     `isError: true`).
 *   - HTTP 200 with populated `errors[]` is surfaced verbatim (GraphQL
 *     partial-success per spec §7.1).
 *
 * Identity binding: the handler refuses to run when `auth.userId` is null
 * (BL-04 — server-derived identity only).
 *
 * Error modes:
 *   - 401 / 403       → auth issue (run `whoami_platform`).
 *   - 5xx             → upstream temporarily unavailable, retry.
 *   - `errors[]` in a 200 response → partial-success; inspect each entry's
 *                                    `message` and `path` to triage.

// 03-REVIEW WR-03: `pageInfo { hasNextPage }` + `totalCount` added so

// schema caps `client_order_ids` at 200 and `clientOrderIDIn` is exact-
// match, so truncation cannot occur — but `lookup_orders_ids` (the
// agent's typical predecessor call in this flow) already requests
// `pageInfo + totalCount`. Asymmetric selection across two tools the
// agent uses in sequence is a debugging footgun; this restores
// symmetry. The handler does NOT branch on these fields — surfacing
// them in the response is enough for the agent to spot truncation.
