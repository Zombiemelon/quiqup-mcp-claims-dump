/**
 * `create_mission` — Phase 4 / MISS-01.
 *
 * Endpoint: POST https://platform-api.quiqup.com/quiqdash/missions
 * Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <session-JWT>, Accept: application/json,
 *           Content-Type: application/json
 *
 * Body shape (per source-doc §8 line 2760 `POST /quiqdash/missions`):
 *   { depotId: string, orderIds: string[], type: string, zone: string }
 *
 * Phase semantics: a mission is a "delivery sortie" covering 1-N orders
 * assigned to a depot and a delivery zone. After creating a mission with
 * an initial order set, agents use `transfer_mission_orders` (MISS-02) to
 * move additional orders into the mission — that companion tool IS
 * destructive-gated because it MOVES orders between missions, but this
 * CREATE is non-destructive because no resource is overwritten.
 *
 * D-05 — Mission-tool destructive gating asymmetry:
 *   - `create_mission` (MISS-01) → NOT destructive-gated. Pure additive
 *     creation; the worst the LLM can do is create a junk mission that
 *     can be ignored or destroyed. Standard write-tool guardrails apply.
 *   - `transfer_mission_orders` (MISS-02) → DESTRUCTIVE-gated. Moves
 *     orders between missions; affects dispatch state on the SOURCE
 *     mission too. Tight 3/min rate-limit + confirm:true + dry_run.
 *
 * Identity binding (BL-04 server-side):
 *   The input schema has NO `user_id` / `actor_id` / `actor_email` /
 *   `partner_id` field. The partner identity is bound server-side from
 *   `auth.userId` — caller-supplied identity is at best ignored and at
 *   worst a cross-tenant smuggling vector. Locked out by schema shape.
 *
 * Guardrails (BL-01 canonical write-tool pattern):
 *   - rateLimit 10/min — mission creation should be rare; bursts misuse.
 *   - idempotency on `idempotency_key` (15min TTL) — safe retries.
 *   - audit: true — repudiation defence.
