/**
 * `create_order_charge` (ORDS-06) — create a one-off charge against a
 * Quiqup order via POST /quiqdash/order-charge on platform-api.quiqup.com.
 *
 * Use cases: extra-weight surcharge, COD adjustment, customer reimbursement,
 * any single-line charge that doesn't fit the original order pricing.
 *
 * Endpoint: POST https://platform-api.quiqup.com/quiqdash/order-charge
 *           Body:  { order_id, amount, currency, description? }
 *           Auth:  Bearer <session-JWT>
 *
 * Phase-4 / Wave-3 single-order mutation. Direct handler (no factory).
 *
 * NOT destructive-gated — this is a CREATE, not an in-place state
 * mutation. The Phase-2 destructive contract is about "would-not-want-to-
 * undo" deletes / state-overwrites; a one-off charge can be voided via
 * a follow-up tool. The risk this tool DOES carry is runaway-agent
 * abuse (T-04-13: "agent decides to charge 1,000,000 AED"), so the
 * `amount` field has a client-side cap.
 *
 * Threat-register mitigation (T-04-13):
 *   `amount: z.number().positive().max(100_000)` — rejects negative,
 *   zero, and absurd values at Zod parse-time, BEFORE the JWT mint and
 *   BEFORE the upstream POST. 100,000 is a generous cap on a single
 *   line-item charge in any of the currencies Quiqup currently
 *   supports; legitimate larger amounts can be split across multiple
 *   charges with explicit caller intent.
 *
 * Guardrails: 5/min rate-limit (charges should be infrequent but
 * not as throttled as the canonical 3/min destructive cap),
 * idempotency-key for safe retry, audit on (financial side-effect).
