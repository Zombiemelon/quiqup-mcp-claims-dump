/**
 * `decide_feature_flags_bulk` — evaluate the feature-flag set for the
 * current account on platform-api.quiqup.com (Phase 1 / AUTH-10).
 *
 * Endpoint: POST https://platform-api.quiqup.com/featureflags/decide-bulk
 * Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <session-JWT>,
 *           Accept: application/json, Content-Type: application/json
 *
 * Request body (per docs/quiqup-api-full-frontend-extract.md):
 *   { Features: string[], Identifier: string }
 *
 * SECURITY INVARIANT (T-01-18 in PLAN.md):
 *   `Identifier` is sourced server-side from `auth.userId` (the Clerk
 *   subject). It is NOT accepted as a tool input. Even if the LLM tries to
 *   smuggle an `Identifier` field via args, the handler builds the upstream
 *   body from the auth context only — so the agent cannot decide flags for
 *   an arbitrary account via this tool. This is the must-have
 *   "decide_feature_flags_bulk binds the input Identifier to the caller's
 *   Clerk session" baked into code.
 *
 * Note: the frontend defaults to all-enabled on upstream failure (graceful
 * degradation in the UI). DO NOT replicate that fallback here — surface
 * errors honestly via QuiqupHttpError so the agent sees the real upstream
 * state instead of silently believing all flags are on.
