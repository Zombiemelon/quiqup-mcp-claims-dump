/**
 * `delete_salla_connection` — DESTRUCTIVE: delete a Salla integration
 * connection by id on platform-api.quiqup.com (Phase 2 / INTG-22).
 *
 * Endpoint: DELETE https://platform-api.quiqup.com/integrations/connections/{id}
 * Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <session-JWT> (Clerk → Quiqup actor-token bridge),
 *           Accept: application/json
 *           (NO body)
 *
 * Response shape: empty (per source-doc lines 4358-4360). This MCP layer
 * synthesizes a structured echo `{ ok: true, deleted: { id }, upstream_status }`
 * so the agent sees a positive confirmation rather than an empty body.
 *
 * Destructive contract (canonical Phase 2+ pattern, see
 * lib/middleware/destructive.ts):
 *   - `confirm: true` MUST be set. Otherwise `requireConfirm` throws
 *     `ConfirmationRequiredError` and the handler returns a structured
 *     isError result naming the resource. NO upstream call is made.
 *   - `dry_run: true` short-circuits AFTER auth + confirm but BEFORE the
 *     upstream DELETE. Pair with `confirm: true` to exercise the gate.
 *   - Tight 3/min rate limit (deletes should be rare).
 *   - audit: true on every call — including rejected (no-confirm) attempts.
 *
 * Companion-tool path:
 *   - `list_integration_connections` (filter source==='salla') discovers the id.
 *   - `get_salla_connection` (02-04) returns the FULL post-state for the
 *     connection (shop_name + site_url + is_fulfillment) — USE IT TO PREVIEW
 *     what you are about to delete BEFORE you set `confirm: true`.
 *
 * Error modes:
 *   - 401 / 403 → auth issue (run `whoami_platform`).
 *   - 404       → connection already deleted upstream, or never existed —
 *                 verify via `list_integration_connections`.
 *   - 5xx       → upstream temporarily unavailable; retry.
