/**
 * `export_order` (ORDS-03) — request a re-export of a single Quiqup order
 * to downstream integrations via the Quiqup REST public API.
 *
 * Endpoint: PUT /orders/export/{id} on api.quiqup.com (production) /
 *           api.staging.quiqup.com (staging).
 *
 * Despite being an HTTP PUT, this is a READ-SHAPED operation per the
 * upstream's quirky API: the call requests a re-export of the order's
 * data to whichever integrations the merchant has wired up. It does not
 * mutate the order itself; it triggers an outbound side-effect that is
 * idempotent at the integration layer (re-exporting the same order
 * twice is a no-op for the receiving integration). For that reason
 * this tool is NOT destructive-gated — there is no `confirm: true`
 * field. Per-order scope-checked under the caller's session BEFORE the
 * PUT runs (a hostile or buggy caller cannot trigger an export for
 * another tenant's order).
 *
 * Phase-4 / Wave-3 single-order mutation. Direct handler (no factory).
 *
 * Auth: V3b Clerk → Quiqup session-JWT bridge — IDENTICAL to every
 * other Quiqup-side write tool. `getQuiqupReadyJwt(auth.userId)` mints
 * the Bearer token; the handler refuses to run when `auth.userId` is
 * null (T-04-17 — auth gate runs BEFORE any work).
 *
 * Guardrails: non-destructive baseline — 10/min rate-limit (re-exports
 * should be infrequent but not as throttled as the canonical 3/min
 * destructive cap), idempotency-key for safe retry, audit-on for the
 * outbound-export trail.
 *
 * Error modes:
 *   - 401/403 → auth issue, run `whoami_platform`.
 *   - 404     → order not visible under caller's session (scope assertion
 *               also rejects this case before the PUT).
 *   - 5xx     → upstream temporarily unavailable, retry.
