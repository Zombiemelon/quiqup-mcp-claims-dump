/**
 * `get_account` — read the signed-in partner's account profile from
 * platform-api.quiqup.com (Phase 1 / AUTH-03).
 *
 * Endpoint: GET https://platform-api.quiqup.com/account
 * Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <session-JWT> (Clerk → Quiqup actor-token bridge),
 *           Accept: application/json
 *           (no `x-api-version` — /account does not require it, unlike /me + /permissions)
 *
 * When to use which (canonical disambiguation — locked in by the
 * tests/tools/auth-account-reads.test.ts assertions):
 *   - `get_account`        → read the signed-in partner's account profile (this tool).
 *   - `whoami_platform`    → auth-vs-payload triage against /me (different endpoint,
 *                            different payload — confirms the JWT resolves at all).
 *   - `get_account_by_id`  → resolve an account by Salesforce id (admin / impersonation
 *                            contexts).
 *
 * Twin write endpoint: AUTH-07 will PUT /accounts to update the same resource,
 * and FIN-05 (Phase 10) will add a constrained bank-details-only PUT variant.
 *
 * Error modes:
 *   - 401 / 403 → auth issue (run `whoami_platform` to confirm the JWT resolves).
 *   - 5xx       → upstream temporarily unavailable; retry after a few seconds.
