/**
 * `get_integration_order` — re-fetch an integration-order envelope by UUID
 * from platform-api.quiqup.com (Phase 2 / INTG-05).
 *
 * Endpoint: GET https://platform-api.quiqup.com/order/{orderUUID}
 * Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <session-JWT> (Clerk → Quiqup actor-token bridge),
 *           Accept: application/json
 *
 * The `order_uuid` arg is path-interpolated and `encodeURIComponent`-escaped
 * (T-02-02: path-injection hygiene). Zod `z.string().min(1)` rejects empty
 * strings at the schema layer.
 *
 * Response shape: large integration-order envelope (per source-doc lines
 * 1144-1411, authoritative). Includes billing_address, shipping, origin_address,
 * products, line_items, refunds, tax_lines, totals, tracking_token, references,
 * version, status, status_reason, …
 *
 * When to call this:
 *   This is the post-repair re-fetch path — use it after
 *   `repair_integration_orders` to confirm a previously-failed order is now in
 *   the expected state. Also useful for one-off envelope inspection when an
 *   agent needs to disambiguate by status/products/totals.
 *
 * Error modes:
 *   - 401 / 403 → auth issue (run `whoami_platform`).
 *   - 404       → no such order_uuid (verify against
 *                 `list_integration_order_reasons[].fulfillment_order_id`).
 *   - 5xx       → upstream temporarily unavailable, retry.
