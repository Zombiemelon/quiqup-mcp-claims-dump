/**
 * `get_order_history` — fetch an order's full state-transition timeline
 * from the Quiqup REST public API (Phase 3 / ORDS-02).
 *
 * Endpoint: GET /orders/{id}/history on the Quiqup REST host
 *   (api.quiqup.com / api.staging.quiqup.com).
 *
 * Auth: Standard V3b Clerk → Quiqup session-JWT bridge — IDENTICAL to
 * every other Quiqup-side read tool. The Bearer header is minted by
 * `getQuiqupReadyJwt(auth.userId)`; the handler refuses to run when
 * `auth.userId` is null (BL-04 server-derived identity gate).
 *
 * Disambiguation: this tool returns the STATE-TRANSITION timeline (when
 * did the order go from `pending` → `live` → `delivered`, by which
 * operator, with which on-hold/return reason). For the FIELD-LEVEL audit
 * log (who edited the address, when, before/after), use
 * `list_order_audit_events` — those are two different upstream services
 * (Quiqup REST vs Audit) with different payload shapes.
