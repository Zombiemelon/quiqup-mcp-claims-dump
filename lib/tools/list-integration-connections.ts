/**
 * `list_integration_connections` — read the partner's cross-family
 * integration-connection catalog from platform-api.quiqup.com
 * (Phase 2 / INTG-01).
 *
 * Endpoint: GET https://platform-api.quiqup.com/integrations/connections
 * Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <session-JWT> (Clerk → Quiqup actor-token bridge),
 *           Accept: application/json
 *
 * Why this tool exists in Phase 2 / Wave 1 (substrate):
 *   This is the single cross-family integrations catalog. Every family-specific
 *   tool (get_shopify_config, list_woocommerce_connections, get_salla_connection,
 *   etc.) takes a connection id or shop_name — they all assume the caller has
 *   already discovered which connections exist on the account. Calling this
 *   first is cheaper than guessing and saves an LLM round-trip on "I don't know
 *   which Shopify store you mean" cases.
 *
 * Response shape (per source-doc lines 1080-1099, authoritative):
 *   { connections: Array<{
 *       id: string,
 *       shop_name: string,
 *       site_url: string,
 *       source: 'shopify' | 'woocommerce' | 'salla' | …,
 *       is_fulfillment: boolean,
 *       token: string,
 *       user_id: string,
 *       created_at: string /* date-time *\/,
 *       updated_at: string /* date-time *\/,
 *   }> }
 *
 * Error modes:
 *   - 401 / 403 → auth issue (run `whoami_platform` to confirm the JWT resolves).
 *   - 5xx       → upstream temporarily unavailable; retry after a few seconds.
