// Mark a pending Quiqup Last-Mile order ready for collection.
//
// Why this tool is the most-dangerous of the writer set: it transitions
// the order from `pending` (cancellable, free) into the live dispatch
// pipeline. From the moment Quiqup picks up the parcel there is real money
// + SLA on the line — re-dispatching on a naive LLM retry would double-bill
// the merchant and pollute the carrier queue. Reference: lastmile.md
// guardrail-mapping section flags this as "irreversible-ish — guardrailed".
//
// M6 guardrails wired here (matched to the threats this endpoint creates):
//   1. SCOPE — `assertOrderBelongsToUser` confirms the order is visible
//      under the caller's session JWT before the mutating PUT. Without
//      this, a hostile or buggy client supplying another merchant's
//      order_id could trigger dispatch they don't own. Quiqup's gateway
//      would also reject (the JWT wouldn't resolve the order), but
//      surfacing the violation here makes it a clean ScopeViolationError
//      in our audit trail instead of an opaque upstream 404 — and
//      short-circuits BEFORE the side-effect attempt.
//   2. RATE LIMIT — 5 dispatches per user per minute. Tuned low because
//      a runaway LLM loop here is uniquely expensive (each call dispatches
//      a real parcel). Capacity 5 absorbs operator burst when readying
//      multiple sibling orders; the 5/60 ≈ 0.083 refill is the sustained
//      ceiling.
//   3. IDEMPOTENCY — optional `idempotency_key` (15-minute TTL). The
//      ergonomic call-shape is one-shot per logical dispatch, so the key
//      is OPTIONAL: omitted, the handler runs unwrapped. Supplied, a
//      retry inside the warm-instance window returns the cached prior
//      result without re-PUTting to Quiqup. Callers SHOULD supply a stable
//      key per logical dispatch (e.g. their own order reference) so a
//      transport-level retry or LLM resample doesn't double-trigger
//      dispatch. The cache lives in-process — sufficient for the
//      LLM-retry-within-seconds threat model; cross-instance dedup is
//      M7 (Redis-backed cache).
//   4. AUDIT — every call logs a structured record to stdout
//      (`audit:` prefix, JSON). Includes userId, orgId, idempotency_key,
//      redacted args, duration, ok/error. The redactor (pii-redact.ts)
//      pins `order_id` and `idempotency_key` to the global-safe set.
//
// ROUTE REGISTRATION: already imported by app/[transport]/route.ts as
// `markReadyForCollectionSpec`; no changes needed there.
