/**
 * `transfer_mission_orders` — Phase 4 / MISS-02 (DESTRUCTIVE-gated).
 *
 * Endpoint: PUT https://platform-api.quiqup.com/quiqdash/missions/transfer/{missionID}
 *           body: { order_ids: [...] }
 * Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <session-JWT>, Accept: application/json,
 *           Content-Type: application/json
 *
 * Semantics: transfer one or more orders INTO the target mission. The
 * upstream removes the orders from their current mission (if any) and
 * assigns them to the named mission. The companion `create_mission`
 * (MISS-01) is NOT destructive-gated because it's pure creation; THIS
 * tool IS destructive-gated (D-05) because it mutates dispatch state on
 * both the source AND target mission. Up to 50 orders per call.
 *
 * Why 50 (vs. 10 for ORDT batch transitions):
 *   Mission transfers are mission-level operations where the realistic
 *   batch size is the mission itself. ORDT batch transitions move a few
 *   ad-hoc orders between states; this tool reassigns an entire mission
 *   manifest. 50 matches the typical mission size envelope observed in
 *   Quiqdash; if a mission exceeds 50 orders, split the transfer into
 *   sequential calls.
 *
 * Hand-written (NOT factory-driven):
 *   The batch-transition factory (lib/tools/_batch-transition-factory.ts)
 *   is shaped for the ORDT path `PUT /quiqdash/orders/batch/{transition}`
 *   with body { order_ids }. This tool's path interpolates a mission_id
 *   segment, so it can't reuse the factory verbatim. It does, however,
 *   import the SAME canonical destructive helpers
 *   (lib/middleware/destructive.ts) and the SAME scope assertion
 *   (lib/middleware/scope.ts::assertOrderBelongsToUser) — the destructive
 *   contract stays uniform even when the URL shape can't be factored.
 *
 * Handler order (T-02-37/38/39 — auth → confirm → scope → dry-run → upstream):
 *   1. `if (!auth.userId) throw` — anon callers see the auth error, not
 *      the confirm error.
 *   2. requireConfirm → throws ConfirmationRequiredError → catch →
 *      buildConfirmationRequiredResult. ZERO upstream traffic.
 *   3. Sequential `assertOrderBelongsToUser` loop (NOT Promise.all —
 *      the assertion endpoint is per-user rate-limited; bursting 50
 *      calls would trip the limit before the destructive PUT runs).
 *      Denials collected; any denial refuses the WHOLE batch.
 *   4. If `dry_run: true` → synthesize `{ dryRun: true, missionId,
 *      orderIds, simulated: {...} }`. ZERO upstream PUT traffic.
 *   5. Mint JWT, PlatformApiClient PUT
 *      `/quiqdash/missions/transfer/${encodeURIComponent(mission_id)}`
 *      with body { order_ids }. Return upstream payload to caller.
 *
 * T-04-22 — cross-tenant order-steal mitigation:
 *   An LLM caller could in principle try to "steal" orders out of
 *   another tenant's mission by transferring them into a mission they
 *   own. The per-id `assertOrderBelongsToUser` loop prevents this:
 *   Quiqup's scope model binds orders to partners, not to missions, and
 *   mission assignment is a transient state. assertOrderBelongsToUser
 *   proves the caller owns the orders — they cannot transfer orders they
 *   don't own. The threat is therefore mitigated STRUCTURALLY by
 *   tenant-level scope, not by a separate mission-membership check.
 *   (Considered: explicit source-mission membership verification.
 *   Rejected: the tenant-scope check already proves ownership; the
 *   "steal from someone else's mission" path requires the attacker to
 *   own the orders in the first place, which the scope loop forbids.)
 *
 * T-04-23 — mission_id path injection mitigation:
 *   `encodeURIComponent(args.mission_id)` on path interpolation so
 *   caller-supplied IDs cannot inject path components.
 *
 * Identity binding (BL-04 — server-side):
 *   No `user_id` / `actor_id` / `actor_email` / `partner_id` on input.
 *   Identity comes from `auth.userId` only.
 *
 * Guardrails (canonical destructive-tool block):
 *   - rateLimit 3/min — tight; mission transfers should be rare.
 *   - idempotency on `idempotency_key` (15min TTL) — safe retries.
 *   - audit: true.
