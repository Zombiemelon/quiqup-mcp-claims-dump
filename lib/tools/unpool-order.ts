/**
 * `unpool_order` (ORDT-14) — DESTRUCTIVE single-order PUT that severs an
 * order's mission assignment without touching the order itself. Returns
 * the order to the unassigned pool.
 *
 * Endpoint: PUT https://platform-api.quiqup.com/quiqdash/missions/unpool/orders/{orderUUID}
 *
 * Why this tool is hand-written (NOT through the factory):
 *   The canonical batch-transition factory at
 *   `lib/tools/_batch-transition-factory.ts` is batch-shaped — it owns
 *   the `order_ids: array` input, the sequential per-id scope-assertion
 *   LOOP, and the batch-PUT body assembly. `unpool_order` is the only
 *   ORDT transition that operates on a SINGLE order id (via path
 *   parameter rather than body array). Forcing it through the factory
 *   would either bend the factory's shape away from "batch" (poisoning
 *   the 11 other ORDT tools) or paper over the difference at the
 *   wrapper layer (defeating the factory's purpose). The cleaner answer
 *   per D-01 specifics: hand-write `unpool_order` against the canonical
 *   destructive helpers directly, mirroring the factory's handler
 *   ordering (auth → confirm → scope → dry_run → upstream) so the gate
 *   contract is identical.
 *
 * Distinct from mission cancellation: the order SURVIVES — only its
 * mission assignment is severed.
 *
 * `order_uuid` must be the UUID form (the `uuid` field on order detail,
 * NOT the integer id). The handler URL-encodes it before interpolation
 * to lock out path-injection.
 *
 * Destructive contract (canonical Phase 2+ pattern):
 *   - `confirm: true` MUST be set; otherwise `requireConfirm` throws
 *     `ConfirmationRequiredError` and the handler returns a structured
 *     isError result. NO upstream PUT is made.
 *   - `dry_run: true` short-circuits AFTER auth + confirm + scope but
 *     BEFORE the upstream PUT. Pair with `confirm: true` to exercise
 *     the gate.
 *   - Sequential scope-assertion via `assertOrderBelongsToUser` runs
 *     BEFORE the dry-run branch so dry-run still fails-fast on
 *     out-of-scope orders.
 *   - Tight 3/min rate limit; 15-min idempotency window; audit on.
