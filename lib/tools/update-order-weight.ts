/**
 * `update_order_weight` (ORDS-07) — update the weight (kg) on a single
 * Quiqup order via PATCH /quiqdash/orders/{orderId}/weight on
 * platform-api.quiqup.com.
 *
 * Endpoint: PATCH https://platform-api.quiqup.com/quiqdash/orders/{orderId}/weight
 *           Body:  { weight: <number-kg> }
 *           Auth:  Bearer <session-JWT>
 *
 * Wire-format note (per the 03-03 wire-format-translation precedent):
 *   The tool's input field is `weight_kg` (explicit unit in the agent-
 *   facing schema — "weight" alone is ambiguous between kg / lb / g and
 *   the Quiqdash UI labels it "kg"). The upstream body key is `weight`
 *   (no unit suffix — the unit is implicit at the BE). The handler
 *   translates `weight_kg` → `weight` on the outbound body. If the
 *   live-staging CALL-LOG (Task 3) shows the BE accepts `weight_kg`
 *   verbatim, the translation can be removed; until then, mirror what
 *   the Quiqdash frontend sends.
 *
 * Phase-4 / Wave-3 single-order mutation. Direct handler (no factory).
 *
 * NOT destructive-gated — this is a value-tune on a numeric attribute,
 * not a state mutation. The Phase-2 destructive contract is about
 * "would-not-want-to-undo" deletes / state-overwrites; correcting a
 * mis-entered weight is a routine operational task. The risk this
 * tool DOES carry is absurd-value abuse (T-04-14: "agent decides
 * weight is 999999kg"), so the `weight_kg` field has a sane range.
 *
 * Threat-register mitigation (T-04-14):
 *   `weight_kg: z.number().positive().max(1000)` — rejects zero,
 *   negative, and absurd values at Zod parse-time. 1000 kg is a
 *   generous cap (one-tonne parcels are well beyond Quiqup's standard
 *   last-mile capability); a heavier consignment requires a different
 *   product entirely and would route around this tool.
 *
 * Guardrails: 10/min rate-limit (non-destructive value-tune), idempotency
 * key for safe retry, audit on (affects downstream pricing / SLA).
