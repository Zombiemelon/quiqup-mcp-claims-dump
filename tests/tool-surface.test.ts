/**
 * Tool-surface snapshot gate — fast-lane vitest mirror of
 * `evals/tool-surface.ts`.
 *
 * This test exists for one reason: catch a silent flip of any tool's
 * disabled-pending-M6 flag in CI on every PR, without waiting for the
 * explicit `bun run eval:tool-surface` step. The eval script and this
 * test share the same snapshot-builder (`evals/tool-surface-shared.ts`)
 * and the same baseline file (`evals/snapshots/tool-surface.json`), so
 * "the test passed in CI" and "the eval passed locally" mean the same
 * thing — there is no second source of truth.
 *
 * When this test fails, the failure message is the diff. Read it:
 *
 *   - "Flipped status" means a tool moved between enabled and
 *     disabled-pending-m6. This is the M6 regression the gate was
 *     designed for. If it's intentional (M6 guardrails shipped, or a
 *     new tool was added with an explicit deferral), update
 *     `evals/snapshots/tool-surface.json` in the same PR.
 *
 *   - "Added tools" / "Removed tools" mean route.ts gained or lost a
 *     registration. Same rule: update the baseline alongside the
 *     registration change so the snapshot diff is part of the PR
 *     review.
 *
 * Do NOT make this test "self-healing" by writing the current snapshot
 * back to disk on failure. The whole point is that the baseline is a
 * tracked, human-reviewed artifact.
